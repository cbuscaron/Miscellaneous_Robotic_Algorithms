% INPUT
% I       120x160x3 numerial array 
%
% OUTPUT
% segI    120x160 numeric array
% loc     1x2 or 2x1 numeric array

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Find ball-color pixels using your model
% 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Do more processing to segment out the right cluster of pixels.
% You may use the following functions.
%   bwconncomp
%   regionprops
% Please see example_bw.m if you need an example code.

% segI = 
% loc = 
% 
% Note: In this assigment, the center of the segmented ball area will be considered for grading. 
% (You don't need to consider the whole ball shape if the ball is occluded.)
